# HQ9+
HQ9+ is a programming language. It is meant to expedite certain workflows.
Very specific workflows.. Workflows that involve of "Hello World!". You
know the kind.

## Description
The interpreter is fully and proudly HQ9+ comptatible. That means it fully
understands all four instructions in the language.
It is written in Scala because why not.

### Instructions
So you want to know what the four instructions are? Fine... Here they are,
- **H**: Print "hello, world"
- **Q**: Print the program's source code
- **9**: Print the lyrics to "99 Bottles of Beer"
- **+**: Increment the accumulator

### Extras
I added the file necessary to use `activator ui` for project management.
Enjoy!
